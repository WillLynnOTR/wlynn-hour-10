I found the game to be predictable. the balls eventually followed a predictable pattern.

what i did was add random speed and different hitboxes to each ball. i also included random rotation to ensure different movement patterns each time

i changed the bumpers shape to further add to the bounce randomness along with cubes to add more angles

at timer is also included. itll print the seconds in a console but will display final time at the end

honestly i think the game by design isn't too fun. its meant to be a educational tool more than a finished thing
